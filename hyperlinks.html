      <br><p>Hyperlinks can be implemented by using a website link and could look like this:</p>
    <a href="https://www.schulhomepage.de/webdesign/html-link">link to website for information on hyperlinks</a>
  <p>For this example the code is as follows: <br>
    <xmp><a href="https://www.schulhomepage.de/webdesign/html-link">link to website for information on hyperlinks</a></xmp>
  <br><br>
  </p>It is also possible to link your own html documents to switch between multiple websites. 
    The code for that could look like this:
    <xmp><a href="main.html">Homepage</a></xmp>
    <p>For this example the link path can be used without changes, 
      but for a document that is in a different folder you would have to write a different path. </p>

    <a href="main.html">Homepage</a>
